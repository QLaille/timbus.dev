# A take on old projects, persistency, and why you should listen to your heart

It feels very odd to pick up a text editor to write again,
it has been a while since I've had the urge to write something.

## Where the heck have I been ?

I've been focusing on finishing and wrapping up my studies, I have now a master's degree on computer science, yay me !
But that means I have had to drop some stuff on the way to focus on me and myself, in terms of personal objectives, lifestyle, schedule, and hobbies.
Putting personal projects, that are not related to software, on the fence always feels like abandoning a little bit of yourself:
> Sometimes it hurts, sometimes it is necessary, and sometimes you forget about it.


## What now, are you picking up blogging again ?

Yes, even if nobody reads what I write, even if this blog ends up on a side of the internet no one has access to, and I'd be quite okay with that.
I have had the feeling to express myself and to write a bit about my point of view on
mental health, especially as a developer, for a very long time, and while this is still a will of mine,
perhaps the best thing I can do to reach my objectives is to reduce the weight on my shoulders.

That doesn't mean dropping this blog though, but perhaps writing more often,
be more concise and publish short paragraphs about my thoughts and feelings, rather than focusing months and months about a subject without writing a single word about it.

---

More often I would hate it, because short posts feels like filling up for the sake of filling up, without any intend or direction,
and it bores people. People hate it when you speak without meaning, people hate small talk, these are just lines to start a conversation,
but when the conversation just never leave that place and never goes into that place where each other can open up their hearts to talk about how they feel, it sucks.

And look at that, in a minute I just wrote for the sake of writing, do you hate it ? I do not, not anymore.

This feels different, deep down it feels like I have to speak about the topic before speaking on the topic.
Just so people get the idea of what is going on. And sometimes neither of us have the idea of what is going on.
Perhaps it will takes paragraphs and paragraphs of small talk about the weather before getting to that big subject that is *How the fuck do you become happy ?*
And the stress provoked by this single question piles up with all the other things we are anxious about.

But that's fine. Most of the time you don't know what's going on.

And despite what your brain is sometimes telling you that you just focus on this and that and whatnot,
because that stupid brain __HATES__ abstract concepts, the brain __HATES__ not knowing what's going on, and it always wants to have an answer to everything,
because that's what the brain do best. But the brain ain't about solving my life, or yours, because if it could be solved, that means everyone would
solve the question of themselves, and it would not be exploited in any way whatsoever (shoot, I'm way too late for that I guess).

That means the only organ you have left to listen to is ~your guts~ your heart.

Your heart is not an organ dedicated to answering complex questions either, but he's the best at understanding how you feel, how you want to feel,
and what you have to do to be that way. He can express itself in many situations: when you are bored, at the restroom, while working, playing video games, or while commuting.
I can't answer for you on that topic, I'm not the expert, you know yourself best.

You don't ? Good answer.

We always lack that small gap in ourselves we have no single clue about what and where it comes from. It just exists for the sake of existing, just like talking for the sake of talking.
It has a meaning, sometimes you have to live with it for a while to understand its principles and purposes. It's a complex topic, and I should've stopped way earlier. This short post is becoming a post in itself.

But isnt a half-digged hole a hole in itself ?
