# Dealing with Burnout as a Student

## The more, the merrier
As a student about to wrap up my Master's Degree in Computer Science, and as a developer, while I'm not working for my company as an intern, I do develop my own ideas on the side, and I have several projects non related to code or applications I want to work on as well, and don't forget the ideas I write down whenever I have some! Here's a *short* list:

* I am currently working on an email client written in flutter, with strong priority to accessibility, and I am hard-working on having a good architecture, layout, interface, and presentation in general.
* I also am taking a course on game design, and working with unity and godot (as I have yet to choose which engine I prefer), and am still wrapping up my head around the concept of layers, how to animate, think of all possible cases, with what I learnt in the past during gamejams.
* I am also working on several web scrapers to retrieve informations I find interesting, based around mechanical keyboards, crypto art, new concepts, tools and ideas of the community, mental health and podcasts.
* I do also work with codepen on several generative-art-like projects, I like the concept of using mathematics to produce soothing and pleasing visuals, and I have yet to progress on that topic, as my maths go back to the time I was at uni studying mechanics, electronics, advanced mathematics 5 years ago.
* I have another side project to, "abuse", the websites giving rewards against surveys, and to mess up with their partners in gathering relevant data.
* I also want to set up discord bots for my friends, to help them moderating their channels, or to provide minigames, or incentives to interact.
* I want to work on a tool to help me manage all those projects, and the spine of that project is already set up fortunately !
* I have as another personal project a tool to build up workbooks for companies, using QRcodes and Augmented Reality, I do not know much on those topics, but I learn a lot along the way!
* I also still am sharpening my skills on code review, by working on old school projects I had, from a shell to a raytracing engine.

And in parallel to that, I still have a ton of other projects I want to work on, I am fixing my old (very old) Gameboy Color, my DSLite, in order to have fun with them by producing music, I am re-learning music theory and re-learning how to play the piano, and developping my ear to better recognize music patterns, instruments, effects; I am also learning how to draw, how to take care of plants, studying chess, and finally, writing for this very blog!

But as you've noticed, my writing schedule isn't that consistant: I'm still tweaking my old articles from studentscope, I do not upload often, and I start a lot of projects, but I don't wrap them up often.

__And that's exactly the point of this post.__

## Eat what's on your plate first, refill when empty

I wanted to have so much on my plate, I felt overwhelmed by all of that.
I did not know where to start, I did not know why I wanted to do all of that, I just knew I wanted to be productive, to show what I could do to the world, how versatile I was, how skillful one could become with such projects.

All I did was burning myself out of all of that.

> "Burnout is real, and it hit me like a yacht that I saw coming from miles away..."

Early december, after validating my end-of-studies project with my school and my colleagues, I knew I was free from this awesome-at-the-beginning-but-turned-out-to-be-a-chore project, which means I started to have a lot of free time to work on other stuff. But I couldn't. I pourred so much into my studies, my internships, my first side projects, my attempts to join multiple communities at once during my five years of computer science studies, that I drained all the energy I had.

By the time the holidays came, I was a ghost, and I still am a mere shadow of myself sometimes, just because I wanted to show off. The blank page syndrome is a struggle: I have difficulties to think and plan ahead, I feel overworked all the time, I have issues to communicate and behave around (and it also impacts my flatmates unfortunately), and I did this to myself.
I thought burnout happened only to people like my father, who spends a lot of time to work for his company with his associate and travels a lot (less frequently now with COVID around though), but burnout is always just around the corner if you do not take the time to change your pace, or how frequently you code, programmer burnout is real, and I hate it. I hate that my school made me work so much on all kinds of projects. I hate that with my spare time, I wanted to develop more and work on more projects. I hate that I am now slowly recovering, not as fast as I want to. I hate all of it.

Burnout is real, it hit me like a yacht that I saw coming from miles away, and I wrongfully ignored it because of that "I am still young" mentality. And now I have nothing to do but warn you all about that danger. Because all I can say is that burnout __will__ happen to you, sooner or later. We are bad at adjusting the time and energy we allocate to things, unless we experience both ends of the spectrum, and we are bad at interpreting the feedback from those things, because we do not talk much around about it, and we do not listen to ourselves and trust ourselves with mental health.

You start with ideas to help every people around you, and you end up staring at a blank page, wondering how to fold it in the shape of a square. And there is no way around but to stop everything that you are doing, everything. You __have__ to stop the engine, drop the laptop and everything that you are doing, quit playing video games, quit all the social medias you are into, stop watching videos and streams, stop listening to music, because all you need at that point is silence, emptiness and boredom. And that is what I did (and still do to catch up my breath), because fortunately I am still a student and I have free time on my hands, the holidays were a lifesaver for me, and it's not that gruesome to take time for oneself to do... nothing. The most difficult part was to not interact with the indie artists I follow and enjoy to listen to, art is such an important vector to me, but stopping the dopamine I receive from this was necessary.

I still have the energy to write about that topic though, and whoever you are, a student, a dev five years into the industry or twenty years into it, please __take the time to slow down__. Seriously. Allow yourself to be at 70% of your capacities. Do not overwork yourself, stop having impactful projects and ideas all around the place. Stop wanting to do everything at once. Can't say it enough, it is a marathon, not a race, and the only objective for you is to have a confortable and efficient pace that is not tiresome. I am still young, and I already have to drastically stop for a moment. You can take the time today to step back and see where you are in your own timeline, how often your brain is in activity, how much of your time you spend being productive, and how much of it you want to be productive. It is perfectly acceptable to not be working on your freetime, you have nothing to prove to anyone, and your own competition is yourself. Consult if necessary, I cannot suggest that enough, if you feel like you cannot tackle this problem alone, please seek help.

Remember, it is a marathon.
