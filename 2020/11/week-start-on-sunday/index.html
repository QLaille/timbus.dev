<h1 id="I-start-my-week-on-Sunday"><a href="#I-start-my-week-on-Sunday" class="headerlink" title="I start my week on Sunday"></a>I start my week on Sunday</h1><h2 id="And-Monday-is-a-good-day"><a href="#And-Monday-is-a-good-day" class="headerlink" title="And Monday is a good day"></a>And Monday is a good day</h2><p>You read it correctly, Sunday is the first day of the week for me.<br>It has been part of my life for a long time, and the benefits outweigh the drawbacks of being out of step from other’s personal plannings. </p>
<p>There are many reasons why you should do the same:</p>
<h2 id="If-sunday-is-your-first-day-monday-doesn’t-suck"><a href="#If-sunday-is-your-first-day-monday-doesn’t-suck" class="headerlink" title="If sunday is your first day, monday doesn’t suck"></a>If sunday is your first day, monday doesn’t suck</h2><p>That’s the first thought I had after seeing every meme you could ever imagine about monday as a programmer,<br>and since monday is the first day of the week, I thought that most people hated starting a new week with the usual routine built around commuting.<br>Because you barely recovered throughout the weekend, you still have a lot of chores to fulfill at home, and you’ve yet to think about what you need to do, and want to do, during the week.<br><strong>With all of that in mind, you are already working yourself to be in a rush, and that’s not how you start a good week</strong>.<br>So what if we could move the time we spend planning our week to another day ? You also unintentionally make your workdays to be from the 2nd to the 6th of the day !</p>
<h2 id="You-can-plan-your-schedule-when-you-have-time-and-not-when-you-don’t"><a href="#You-can-plan-your-schedule-when-you-have-time-and-not-when-you-don’t" class="headerlink" title="You can plan your schedule when you have time, and not when you don’t"></a>You can plan your schedule when you have time, and not when you don’t</h2><p>Most sundays would start with you chilling at home, with a mug of chaï, watching movies, playing games of chess or whatnot.<br>And I’m 100% sure that you can fill at least 10 minutes in that veeeery busy schedule to plan the current week (and yes, that also means this sunday, not the one at the end of the week,<br>but the one at the beginning of the week): what do you have to do, what do you want to do and what do you want to learn, discover, or experiment. Activities, chores, nap-times, breaks, work.<br>And you will end up after 10 minutes with an easy to manage planning, a simple to-do lists, and a free mind.</p>
<h2 id="Monday-is-a-good-day"><a href="#Monday-is-a-good-day" class="headerlink" title="Monday is a good day"></a>Monday is a good day</h2><p>Again, yes, you read that correctly. I’ve learned nowadays to enjoy Mondays.<br>Not because I’m getting back to work, but because my mind is free from planning my week and my weekends, the projects I wish to do, the chores I have to do, and .<br>I also don’t forget tasks, and I can enjoy the time I have during commuting or while idling to do other activities.<br>I don’t spend time rambling around on monday morning anymore and I’m not in a rush anymore.<br>It also gives me free time to spend on other activities, such as side projects, extra exercising, and I can read again !<br>It leads to less procrastination, stress and bad thoughts, because of the small amount of time you spent on sunday morning instead of having immediate gratification via games or movies,<br>and you don’t feel like a bad person for forgetting what needs to be done.</p>
<h2 id="Keep-free-time-for-nothing"><a href="#Keep-free-time-for-nothing" class="headerlink" title="Keep free time for nothing"></a>Keep free time for nothing</h2><p>In the end, you’ll have more time, and I suggest you spend some of that time doing…<br>Nothing, being bored is acceptable, will happen, and you just need to make room for it.</p>
<p>It helps you progressing has a person, you take time to think about yourself, your milestones, how you evolved through time, your surroundings and much more !<br>And perhaps sometimes, if you feel that boredom is boring, you can spend your free time on planning your month, or even your budget !</p>
