For the newcomers, welcome, you are free to stay for as long as you need.</p>
<h2 id="Who-are-you"><a href="#Who-are-you" class="headerlink" title="Who are you ?"></a>Who are you ?</h2><p><strong>I am Timbus, and I am a happy human being.</strong></p>
<p>I’m a versatile developer who enjoys interactions, whenever it is to learn, teach or just share information.<br>I am currently specializing in software development in my last year of studies, and I love what I do and how I make it known to people.<br>As of today, I speak as much as I can about my journey and where I stand as of today as a person, because I want others to find their own path, understand themselves, and become happy too.<br>This involves personal tips, point of views, gathered knowledge and a lot of questions.<br>I tend to apply logic to my daily decisions, and am keen to follow stoicism, so I will be referring a lot to it. Some people don’t agree to the principles, but that’s fine, it’s not asking you to blindly follow the rules, and you can always bend them to your will.</p>
<h2 id="How-often-will-you-write-posts"><a href="#How-often-will-you-write-posts" class="headerlink" title="How often will you write posts ?"></a>How often will you write posts ?</h2><p>Before my previous website, StudentScope, I’ve never written for someone else but me (besides school exams), and while the experience was amazing, it was also relieving to see that what I wanted for others to read worked, and raised several questions and conversations around my posts.<br>I try to be as consistent as possible in how often I write and raise questions: My goal is to publish at least one article per month,and I would love to get that up to once every two weeks.</p>
<p>As of today, the plan is to retrieve and rework on my old posts, there is 4 of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Studying Abroad</li>
<li>Planning your time</li>
<li>Egoism</li>
</ul>
<p>Following those 4 posts, I will get on new topics. I often asked to my friends about which topic I should cover, from a list of 6/7 subjects I wanted to talk about, I plan on getting you involved in the process, I’m still thinking about the best option available.</p>
<h3 id="Can-we-get-in-touch"><a href="#Can-we-get-in-touch" class="headerlink" title="Can we get in touch ?"></a>Can we get in touch ?</h3><p>If you wish to recruit me or have a request for me (when I’m available), you can always reach out via the contact page (or mail me via the footer).<br>I will try to add a way for you to interact on a post ASAP, but for now this will do. My plan is to have all of this available for everyone for as long as possible, in hope that it becomes useful for someone else than me.</p>
